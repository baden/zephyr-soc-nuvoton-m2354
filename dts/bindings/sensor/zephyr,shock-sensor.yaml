  Description for a voltage sensor, with ability to measure
  hit strength by microphone.
  An example sensor that reads the ADC amplitude defined in io-channels.

  Example definition in devicetree:

    shock_sensor: shock_sensor {
      compatible = "zephyr,shock-sensor";
      status = "okay";
      io-channels = <&eadc 15>;
    };

compatible: "zephyr,shock-sensor"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  io-channels:
    required: true
    description: |
      Channels available with this divider configuration.

  power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Control power to the sensor if present.

      If present the corresponding GPIO must be set to an active level
      to enable the divider input.

  sampling-period-ms:
    type: int
    default: 100
    description: |
      Period to sample the sensor in milliseconds.
